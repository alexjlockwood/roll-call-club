# Blue Spins Faster Than Orange

## Overview

It is extremely important to understand that **the blue roll spins slightly faster than the orange roll** throughout the duration of a Roll Off timeout. These different speeds mean that the rolls will align differently each lap.

For example, the picture below shows how the blue and orange rolls align for the last 1:30 minutes of the timeout.

Notice how the orange roll aligns differently relative to the blue roll after each lap. *This is because blue spins slightly faster relative to orange, causing the alignment to change each lap.* In this case, it means that the transfer from blue to orange gets slightly more difficult with each lap.

## Why this is important

Many players focus all of their energy on memorizing a single path to take early in the timeout. However, because they fail to take the different speeds into account, they are suddenly surprised when the path they have memorized suddenly doesn't work and they die because of it. Knowing that blue spins faster than orange will allow you to prepare for these potential surprises ahead of time and increase your chances of survival.

!!! tip

    If you find yourself consistently dying late in a Roll Off timeout, it could be
    because you aren't taking into account the fact that blue spins faster than orange,
    which causes the alignment to change.

## Example

A good strategy is to keep an eye out for any parts of your path that are becoming gradually more difficult. Once identified, you can use the knowledge that blue spins faster than orange to prepare for the next lap.

For example, the clip below shows a lap of an [Easy 4 + Open-Closed](../variations/easy-4-open-closed.md) Roll Off variation. Note that the transfer from blue to orange is trivial and easy to execute:

However, on the very next lap I notice that the transfer from blue to orange has suddenly become very tight. At this point I realize that since blue spins faster than orange, this transfer will be extremely risky on the next lap:

</video>

As a result, I know that on the next lap I must change my path. So instead of starting on blue like I was doing before, I start on orange and transfer to blue so I can avoid this dangerous transfer entirely:
