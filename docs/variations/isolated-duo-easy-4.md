# Isolated Duo + Easy 4

![Isolated Duo + Easy 4](../images/variations/isolated-duo-easy-4.jpg)

## Overview

[Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#orange) + [Easy 4](../rolls/easy-4.md#blue) is a relatively easy variation, due to the amount of free space at the end of blue. Starting on orange late in is key as you're able to make a transition not too tight over to blue then back to orange then back to blue to end the 4 jumps.
