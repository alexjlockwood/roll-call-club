# Closed-Open + Open-Closed

![Closed-Open + Open-Closed](../images/variations/closed-open-open-closed.jpg)

## Overview

[Closed-Open](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md#orange) + [Open-Closed](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md#blue) is considered the 4th hardest Roll Off variation to timeout. The first 8 laps are very easy, with 3 easy jumps to start on blue and 3 easy jumps to end on orange. However, the variation becomes very difficult to execute on laps 9-12 when the slime has reached it's maximum height.

## Paths

There are 5 possible paths to take on laps 9-12 of the timeout:

### Alex's Path

## Recommended Pathing

Here is an example of what an ideal 3 person timeout looks like for this variation:

* 1 player takes Alex's path on laps 9-12
* 1 player takes PG's path on laps 9-12
* 1 player takes JD's path on laps 9-12

The most difficult part about this variation is if 2 players will end up on the small inner ledge before the 2nd wall on orange. It is very important that one player jump dives back to blue early so to give the other player enough time to do the same without being body blocked.
