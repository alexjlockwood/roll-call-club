# Easy 4 + Pillar Trench

![Easy 4 + Pillar Trench](../images/variations/easy-4-pillar-trench.jpg)

## Overview

[Easy 4](../rolls/easy-4.md#orange) + [Pillar Trench](../rolls/pillar-trench.md) starts off easy, with 4 jumps at the beginning of orange and 3 jumps in the middle of blue. The ending of each lap can be difficult with multiple players, especially towards the end of the timeout.

## Paths

There are 2 paths you can take to survive the final transfer on laps 9-12 of the timeout. I recommend taking whichever path has less players, as it can be very easy to collide otherwise.

### End on Orange
