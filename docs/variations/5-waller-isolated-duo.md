# 5 Waller + Isolated Duo

![5 Waller + Isolated Duo](../images/variations/5-waller-isolated-duo.jpg)

## Overview

[5 Waller](../rolls/5-waller.md) + [Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#blue) is made difficult due to the lack of free space available on orange, forcing most players on blue for a majority of the timeout.

## Paths

### Standard Path

The standard path is to make your way to the inner orange ledge before the 2nd wall on 5 Waller, transfer back to blue, and make the long jump on blue. This avoids the 1st god jump on Isolated Duo blue that can be difficult to perform. However, it can be fairly dangerous with many players all attempting to transfer to the same small orange ledge.

### God Jump Path

A less dangerous path is to use the god jump on Isolated Duo blue. This avoids desync in the middle of the rolls where players are rapidly transfering between orange and blue. Be sure to practice the [Isolated Duo god jumps](../advanced/isolated-duo-god-jumps.md) beforehand as they can be difficult to perform when the slime reaches maximum level.
