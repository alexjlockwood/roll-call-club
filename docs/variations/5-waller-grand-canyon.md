## Recommended Pathing

Here is an example of what an ideal 3 person timeout looks like for this variation:

* 1 player starts on blue laps 9-12
* 1 player takes the grand canyon ledge laps 9-12
* 1 player outer wall jumps laps 9-12

!!! note

    In the rare case that you must have 3 players in the center during laps 9-12, 
    you should coordinate as follows:

    - First player runs **in front** and takes **grand canyon ledge**
    - Second player runs **behind** and **inner wall jumps**
    - Third player starts on blue
