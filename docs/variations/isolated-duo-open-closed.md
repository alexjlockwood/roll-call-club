# Isolated Duo + Open-Closed

![Isolated Duo + Open-Closed](../images/variations/isolated-duo-open-closed.jpg)

## Overview

[Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#orange) + [Open-Closed](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md#blue) offers lots of free space at the beginning of each lap, with 3 jumps on blue and open space at the start of orange. Remember that the 2nd long jump on orange is a [god jump](../advanced/isolated-duo-god-jumps.md), so be sure to transfer back to blue if you aren't comfortable executing it.
