# Easy 4 + Grand Canyon

![Easy 4 + Grand Canyon](../images/variations/easy-4-grand-canyon.jpg)

## Overview

[Easy 4](../rolls/easy-4.md#orange) + [Grand Canyon](../rolls/grand-canyon.md) is the easiest grand canyon variation, due to the fact that the 4 easy jumps to start on orange means you can easily avoid the large gap on Grand Canyon entirely. That said, it is still somewhat difficult due to some of the tight pinches that are required late in the timeout.

## Paths

There are 3 paths you can take to survive the final transfer on laps 9-12 of the timeout. I recommend taking whichever path has less players, as it can be very easy to collide otherwise.
