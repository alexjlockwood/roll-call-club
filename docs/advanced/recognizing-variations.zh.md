# 提前识别版型

!!! note "注意"

    从2023年5月更新的SS4赛季开始，滚轮行动的准备界面动画有较大变化，导致可以用来识别版型的信息变少。

在准备界面的动画播放时，玩家可以尝试快速识别出滚轮版型，这样在第1圈就不用花时间识别了。

## 通过彩边和侧面条纹颜色识别

橙轮的彩边有紫色和金色。如果是紫色，则可能是[橙4](../rolls/easy-4.md#橙轮)、[橙2](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md#橙轮)或[橙多挡板](../rolls/5-waller.md)；如果是金色，则可能是[橙浮岛](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#橙轮)或[橙多挡板](../rolls/5-waller.md)。

蓝轮的彩边有橙色、紫色和金色。如果是橙色，则可能是[蓝4](../rolls/easy-4.md#蓝轮)、[蓝多挡板](../rolls/pillar-trench.md)或[蓝天坑](../rolls/grand-canyon.md)；如果是紫色，则必然是[蓝浮岛](../rolls/isolated-duo.md#蓝轮)；如果是金色，则必然是[蓝3](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md#蓝轮)。

特别地，[蓝天坑](../rolls/grand-canyon.md)是唯一一个侧面条纹颜色与其他蓝轮不同的版型。蓝天坑的侧面条纹为橙色（其他蓝轮均为蓝色），前后条纹为绿色（其他滚筒均和彩边为同一颜色），钢筋为黄色（其他蓝轮均为紫色）。

## 通过开头和结尾的障碍识别

以下是一个可以用来识别版型的决策树。由于准备界面动画的改变，这种方法已不太实用。

## Rolls

The strategies you can use to detect each roll early on are described below.

### 5 Waller

[5 Waller](../rolls/5-waller.md) has pillars in front and nothing in back. The picture below shows 5 Waller orange.

![5 Waller](../images/advanced/recognizing-variants/5-waller.jpg)

### Isolated Duo

[Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md) has nothing in front and pillars in back. The picture below shows Isolated Duo orange and Isolated Duo blue.

![Isolated Duo](../images/advanced/recognizing-variants/isolated-duo.jpg)

### Closed-Open & Open-Closed

[Closed-Open and Open-Closed](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md) can both be recognized by the fact that they have pillars in front and pillars in back. The picture below shows Closed-Open orange and Open-Closed blue.

![Closed-Open & Open-Closed](../images/advanced/recognizing-variants/closed-open-open-closed.jpg)

### Easy 4

[Easy 4](../rolls/easy-4.md) has a wall in front and pillars in back. The picture below shows Easy 4 orange and Easy 4 blue.

### Grand Canyon

[Grand Canyon](../rolls/grand-canyon.md) has a wall in front and a wall in back. The picture below shows Grand Canyon blue.

![Grand Canyon side view](../images/advanced/recognizing-variants/grand-canyon.jpg)

[Grand Canyon](../rolls/grand-canyon.md) is the only roll with green striped inner edges and a yellow bar.

### Pillar Trench

Like Grand Canyon, [Pillar Trench](../rolls/pillar-trench.md) also has a wall in front and a wall in back. The picture below shows Pillar Trench blue.

![Pillar Trench](../images/advanced/recognizing-variants/pillar-trench.jpg)

To differentiate it from Grand Canyon, check that the roll has oranged striped inner edges and a purple bar.

## Other tips

[Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md) Blue can be recognized early by its purple edge color, as it is the only blue roller with purple edges.

![Isolated Duo Blue](../images/advanced/recognizing-variants/isolated-duo-blue-side-view.jpg)

Similarly, [Open-Closed](../rolls/closed-open-open-closed.md) Blue can be recognized early by its gold edge color, as it is the only blue roller with gold edges.
