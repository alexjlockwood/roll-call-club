# Isolated Duo God Jumps

!!! note

    In May 2024, the jump height of a Fall Guy bean was increased, making isolated duo 
    god jumps relatively easy compared to earlier versions of the game.

Each [Isolated Duo](../rolls/isolated-duo.md) roll has a long jump that can be done with a simple jump dive, and a "god jump" that is more difficult to execute, especially when the slime reaches it's maximum level.

To perform the god jump, be sure to:

* Time the jump so that you are positioned closer to the back, so that you are running slightly up hill when you perform the jump.
* Jump off the very edge of the roll, as close to the edge that you can get. Think of the jump dive as if you were performing a god jump in Hex-A-Gone.
* Get used to the timing of the mid-air dive after the jump. You won't see the roll when you perform the dive, and you'll just need to trust that it will be there by the time you land.
